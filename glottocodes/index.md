# Finding Glottocodes

In this tutorial, we will find the Glottocodes for the language areas shown on the Alor-Pantar map (Schapper, 2020).  We georeferenced the map in the [Georeferencing tutorial](../georeferencing/index.md), digitised the language areas in the [Digitising tutorial](../digitising/index.md) and recorded attributes and metadata in the [Attributes and Metadata tutorial](../metadata/index.md). 


## Requirements 

**Software:** [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level free and open-source programming language. This tutorial uses version 3.12 with the `guess_glottocode` package installed. For installation instructions, see below.

**Data:** A GeoPackage file containing the language polygons (see the [Digitising tutorial](../digitising/index.md)) and attributes (see the [Attributes and Metadata tutorial](../metatdata/index.md)). The Alorâ€“Pantar language polygons, including attribute data, can be downloaded [here](../digitising/out/schapper2020papuan.gpkg).  Note that this file already includes a `glottocode` column, which we will ignore for the purposes of this tutorial.

**API keys:** The `guess_glottocode` package sends requests to a large language model (LLM) provider to find Glottocodes. Currently supported providers are [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys). To use either service, you must first create an API key from the provider (see below).


## What is a Glottocode? 

Glottocodes are unique identifiers for languages, dialects, and language families, maintained by [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org).  
The simplest way to find a Glottocode is to look it up manually:

1. Go to Glottolog.  
2. Enter the language name into the search box.  
3. Copy the Glottocode from the resulting page.  

This works fine for a few languages, but it quickly becomes tedious when you need dozens or hundreds of Glottocodes.  
Instead, we can add Glottocodes programmatically using the [`guess_glottocode` package] (https://github.com/derpetermann/guess_glottocode) in Python. The package can guess a language's Glottocode either using a large language model (LLM) via an API or by querying Wikipedia. This tutorial focuses on finding Glottocodes with an LLM.  


## Install the `guess_glottocode` package

The package requires Python 3.12+ and depends on several other packages, including:

- `geopandas` (for handling geospatial data)
- `wptools` (for querying Wikipedia)
- `anthropic` and `google-genai` (for LLM-based lookups)
- `keyring` (for handling API credentials)

All dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml` and will be installed automatically. To install the package, run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/derpetermann/guess_glottocode.git
```

Full installation guidelines are available in the project's [README file](https://github.com/derpetermann/guess_glottocode/blob/main/README.md).

## API keys

When using a large language model (LLM) to find a Glottocode, the package sends a request to an LLM provider.  Currently supported providers are **Google Gemini** and **Anthropic**. To use either service, you must first create an API key.

- **Google Gemini** - Create an API key at [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).  
  You'll need a Google account and must be logged in.
- **Anthropic** - Create an API key at [https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).  
  You'll need to sign up for and log in to an Anthropic account.

Moderate use of the package should not incur third-party API costs, but heavy usage may.

The first time you call `llm.guess_glottocode` with Gemini or Anthropic, the package will prompt you to enter your API key.  The key is stored securely on your local machine via the `keyring` package, so you won't need to enter it again in future sessions.

## Load the data

First, we load the Alor-Pantar GeoPackage file using GeoPandas' `read_file()` function. GeoPandas is a Python library for working with geospatial data in tabular form. Its `read_file()` function imports spatial data into a GeoDataFrame, preserving both attribute data and geometry, including the coordinate reference system (CRS).


```python
import geopandas as gpd
polygons = gpd.read_file("schapper2020papuan.gpkg")
```

We can quickly inspect the GeoDataFrame by displaying the first 10 entries, confirming that it includes a geometry as well as all attributes and metadata recorded in the [Attributes and Metadata tutorial](../metadata/index.md). Note that it already contains a `glottocode` column with entries for most languages; for the purposes of this tutorial, we will ignore it and generate Glottocodes using a large language model.

```python
print(polygons.head(10))
```

## Finding a Suitable Glottocode Using an LLM

While large language models (LLMs) can sometimes guess a language's Glottocode from its name, this approach is unreliable. LLMs may hallucinate nonexistent codes or confuse languages with similar names.  A more reliable approach is to 

1. Generate a set of candidate Glottocodes based on a geographic filter
2. Use the LLM to identify the most suitabele Glottocode of these.

The `geo_filter_glottocodes` function searches Glottolog for entries located within a defined spatial area.  In our case, theese are language polygons digitised earlier including a user-defined buffer. The buffer ensures that spatial uncertainty between the map and Glottolog is taken into account when filtering candidates. It is key to finding a matching Glottocode. If the buffer is too broad, it will return too many candidate Glottocodes, leading to a long prompt, higher token costs, and potentially suboptimal results. A small buffer risks excluding the correct Glottocode. Users can also specify the classification level, excluding Glottocodes that refer to dialects or (sub-)families as needed.

The `llm.guess_glottocode` function then sends the candidate list to and LLM via an API, either Google Gemini or Anthropic, and receives the best match.

The helper function `glottocode_per_row` below combines both steps. It iterates over all rows in the GeoDataFrame, applying a 200 km buffer around each language polygon to gather all Glottocodes in that area, regardless of classification level (`level="all"`). Glottolog's classification may not align exactly with that of the Alor-Pantar map. For example, what the map considers a language might be classified as a dialect or subfamily in Glottolog. The function then sends the candidates to the Google Gemini LLM via its API and receives the most suitable Glottocode.


```python
import guess_glottocode.llm as llm
from guess_glottocode.utils import geo_filter_glottocodes

def glottocode_per_row(row):
    # Geographic filter to find candidate Glottocodes
    candidates = geo_filter_glottocodes(language_location=row.geometry,
                                        buffer=200,
                                        level="all")
    # LLM to find the most suitable candidate
    return llm.guess_glottocode(language=row['name'],
                                candidates=candidates,
                                api="gemini")
# Iterate over all rows and apply helper function to each
polygons['unverified_glottocode'] = polygons.apply(glottocode_per_row, axis=1)
```

## Verify the Glottocde match

We can verify Glottocode matches using additional information maintained by Glottolog. Each Glottocode is linked to a GitHub page containing the language's primary name and any alternative names. The `verify_glottocode_guess` function queries that page and checks whether the language name appears as the primary name or among the alternatives. If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.  

The helper function `verify_per_row` below iterates over all rows in the GeoDataFrame with tentative, unverified Glottocodes. It confirms the Glottocode if verified or sets it to `None` if not.

```python
from guess_glottocode.utils import verify_glottocode_guess

def verify_per_row(row):
    return row.unverified_glottocode if (
            verify_glottocode_guess(row['name'],
                                    row['unverified_glottocode'])) else None

polygons['glottocode'] = polygons.apply(verify_per_row, axis=1)
```

After verifying the Glottocodes, we can display the results for each language to see which have confirmed matches.

```python
print(polygons.head[['name', 'glottocode']])
```
                  name   glottocode

The approach successfully identified and verified Glottocodes for 18 out of 25 languages. The entries with `None` indicate that no verified Glottocode was found automatically, so these will need to be added manually or through further refinement, such as a larger buffer size.


## Export to file 

Once the Glottocodes are verified, we remove the column `unverified_glottocode` and export the GeoDataFrame to a `GeoPackage` file.

```python
polygons = polygons.drop(columns=["unverified_glottocode"])
polygons.to_file("schapper2020papuan.gpkg", driver="GPKG")
```

We also export the attribute information as a `CSV` file. For details on why this file is needed, see the [Attributes and metadata tutorial](../metadata/index.md).

```python
polygons.drop(columns="geometry").to_csv("schapper2020papuan.csv", index=False)
```

## Output

A GeoPackage file containing the language polygons (see the [Digitising tutorial](../digitising/index.md)), attributes, and Glottocodes (see also the [Attributes and metadata tutorial](../metadata/index.md)).  The Alorâ€“Pantar language polygons, including attribute data and Glottocodes, can be downloaded [here](../digitising/out/schapper2020papuan.gpkg). Note that in this file some Glottocodes were added manually.  

A CSV file containing the attribute and Glottocode data, linked to the digitised polygons via the `id` column. The CSV file for the Alorâ€“Pantar language polygons can be downloaded [here](../metadata/out/schapper2020papuan.csv).
